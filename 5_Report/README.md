In any organisation or institute it is very important to keep a note of all the employees/ students/ people working in there. When this imformation is stored in their databases it has to be arranged alphabetically. This sorting will help the organisation to access the details easily and quickly. To this cause the project "Organise Names" is designed. In this project the input details(say the employee details) are stored and arranged alphabetwise. Also if one wishes to search a particular name from the entered list he/she can do it. This project supports that as well.

Some of the requirements identified are:
- Correctly intake the given values.
- Display the details properly.
- Sort it alphabetwise.
